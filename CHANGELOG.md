## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Claude Code: use `~/.claude.json` on all platforms; add project-scoped MCP servers under `projects[<abs path>].mcpServers` so servers are active per project; adjust list/has to honor project scope.

  - Added JSON logging format option
  - Added async file operations with error handling
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing logger API
- Consolidated duplicate `MCPServerConfig` type definitions
- Documentation updated to reflect current CLI:
  - Use `alph setup` (replacing references to `alph configure`)
  - `status` command examples simplified (no `--output` flag)
  - Installation docs use scoped package `@aqualia/alph-cli` and Node.js 18+
- CONTRIBUTING updated: Node 18+ required and pack/install instructions fixed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-18

### Added
- Subcommand-based CLI (`configure`, `status`) via `src/commands/unified.ts`.
- Access key support for MCP servers with automatic redaction in all outputs.
- Interactive wizard improvements: prefilled values, masked access key prompt.
- Robust CLI flag parsing and safe argv-fallback gated by `ALPH_ARGV_FALLBACK=1`.

- Status command (`src/commands/status.ts`) shows table/JSON outputs with sensitive value redaction.
- Documentation (`README.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`) updated to reflect subcommands and security practices.

### Security
- Secrets and access keys redacted consistently (show only last 4) across CLI previews and status output.

### Testing
- Added focused Jest tests for configure and status commands covering interactive delegation, dry-run, filtering, JSON redaction, and missing config handling.

## Migration Guide

### From askhumanctl (Go) to alph-cli (NPM)

1. **Uninstall old binary**:
   ```bash
   # Remove from PATH or delete binary
   ```

2. **Install new NPM package**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g alph-cli
   ```

3. **Update commands**:
   ```bash
   # Old command
   askhumanctl setup --mcp-server-id id --mcp-access-key key
   
   # New command  
   alph setup --mcp-server-endpoint https://askhuman.net/mcp/id --bearer key -y
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   alph --help
   ```

All functionality remains the same, only the installation method and command name have changed.
